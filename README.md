# RLpapers

This repo lists all the books, papers, and codes I used for my own RL journey.
I will constantly update my progress with my own annotated papers [paper_annot] and code implemented [code] as I continue.
As I'm studying, I will also work on a [RL Jargons List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TtQPn9n78hDxVIOh44XMBY4sJA3ST4iV2b_Qbw4r5cM/edit#gid=0) for an organized place to list unfamiliar terms.

The papers that are numbered below are part of our curriculum at [DIYA](https://blog.diyaml.com/)'s MultiAgentRL team, where our goal is to read two papers and review them together every week. The other papers are composed to supplement my understandings whenever I have extra time.
